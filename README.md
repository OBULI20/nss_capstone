## Overview
  The primary objective of this project is to analyze the effects of rising housing prices on the ability of consumers to afford homeownership. It will explore the relationship between house prices, income levels, mortgage rates, and other economic factors to understand how consumers' purchasing power is affected in different market conditions and US states. I have considered analysis including 2014 to 2023.Key variables include Price-to-Income ratio, Mortgage payment-to-income ratio, household Debt-to-Income ratio and housing affordability Index.

## Data Question
  How do higher prices impact consumers affordability to buy house? 

## Gathering the Data
  Using Python, I scrapped data for house prices from websites and converted it into a data frame. For the map, I downloaded a Json file which had the polygon geometry for states, and I created a centroid to facilitate popups at the centroid. Collected historical data on housing prices, income levels, mortgage rates, and other relevant economic indicators by importing from government sources, real estate platforms, and financial institutions.


## Analyzing the Data
  I did Exploratory Data Analysis around median income,KPI(Key performance indicator) in each state and compared with influencing factors affecting savings for down payment and mortgage payments. 


## Visualizing the Data
  I utilized seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations and then moved them to Power point. I used Power Bi to create visualizations to do interactive analysis and visuals. I imported the data into Power Bi and framed median income column to check the affordability of oneself.

## Technologies
  Python - pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, Power Bi

  Power Bi - visualizations

  Ms Excel - vlookups, hlookups, maths and statistics
